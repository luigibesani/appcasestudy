              Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
              With the increasing prevalence of IoT and AI, the need and value of data are at an all-time high. More than ever, companies are feeding off user
              information in order to gain insight and make decisions which will increase their revenue.
            </br></br>
              What is not widely known is that this data, which is shown to have actual monetary value to many companies, is either given away during opt-in
              license agreements or simply not used at all.
            </br></br>
            What users are lacking is the ressources that will allow them to decide how take control of their data.

            Our challenge 
          </h2>
        <p>
          Users unkowingly opt-in to provide personal data on daily basis when using the platforms and tools scattered over the internet when they could
          potentially be selling this data at a higher price.
        </br></br>
          YOUR demographic data, social data, financial data, health data has a monetary value therefore
          it is crucial to start taking control of your personal data and who can gain access to it.
        </br></br>
          This is where FreeYourData comes into play.

          Our solution 
        </h2>
      <p>

        Understanding our users 
      </h2>
    </br>
      <h4>The survey</h4>
      <p>
      Through the use of a survey we have written, we were able to extract relevant data about potential users which allowed us to learn about their specific needs
      and their feelings towards an online marketplace.
      </br>
      To maximize the efficiency of our research, we start off the survey by asking demopgrahic type questions which will come in handy when trying
      to generate personas or when simply trying to picture potential users and their characteristics.
      </br></br>
      The following questions allowed us to gain more understanding about our users in terms of awareness of the value their data, their level of comfort associated
      with selling personal data, and their likeliness to different categories of personal data.
     </p>
  </div>
  <h4>The user personas</h4>
  <p>
    The data collected from the survey demonstrated that a wide demographic of users were interested in participating in data marketplace to varying degrees.
  </br></br>
    The next step was to generate users personas which could act as great examples of potential users of the FreeYourData platform. We decided to go with 3 personas
    as this would allow us to have one persona ressemble the average user (based on our survey) and two personas to represent outlier users. We generate
    3 different personas to demonstrate demographic range but ultimately we will focus on one persona to demonstrate user flow and journey.
